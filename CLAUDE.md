## 📚 Learning Materials (Important for Agents!)

This project contains **extensive educational reference documents** in multiple locations. These files are **comprehensive learning materials** (240 KB total) that should **NOT be read automatically** to conserve tokens.

### Documentation Locations:

1. **`docs/fundamentals/`** - Phase 1 foundations (119 KB, 4 hours reading)
2. **`docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/`** - Phase 2 patterns (121 KB, 4.5 hours reading)
3. **`ecommerce-microservices/docs/`** - Practical implementation guides

### Instructions for Claude Agents:

**DO NOT:**
- Automatically scan or read files in `docs/fundamentals/`
- Automatically scan or read files in `docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/`
- Automatically scan or read files in `ecommerce-microservices/docs/`
- Load these files into context unless explicitly needed
- Include them in exploratory file reads

**ONLY read these files when:**
1. User explicitly asks about a topic covered in the docs
2. User directly references a specific doc file
3. The current task is directly related to the concepts explained
4. User asks to explain a specific pattern or concept

**How to decide if relevant:**
1. First, check the relevant INDEX file:
   - `docs/fundamentals/INDEX.md` - For Phase 1 topics
   - `docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/INDEX.md` - For Phase 2 topics
   - `ecommerce-microservices/docs/INDEX.md` - For practical guides
2. Read the brief description in the INDEX
3. Only open the full document if it directly answers the user's question
4. Read only the specific section needed, not the entire document

### Available Topics:

#### Phase 1: Fundamentals (docs/fundamentals/)
**Total:** 119 KB across 3 documents + INDEX

- **Monolith Limitations** (~26 KB)
  - Scalability bottlenecks, deployment risks, technology lock-in, team coordination

- **Distributed Systems Fundamentals** (~50 KB)
  - CAP Theorem, ACID vs BASE, Network Fallacies, Consistency Models

- **System Design Principles** (~43 KB)
  - Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility, Loose Coupling/High Cohesion, Design for Failure

#### Phase 2: Architecture Patterns (docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/)
**Total:** 121 KB across 3 documents + INDEX

- **Microservices Architecture** (~40 KB)
  - Service boundaries, communication patterns, service mesh, API Gateway

- **Event-Driven Architecture** (~43 KB)
  - Event sourcing, CQRS, event streaming vs messaging, Saga pattern

- **Architectural Patterns** (~38 KB)

- Docker volumes and data persistence
- Daemons vs processes
- Microservices communication patterns
- Message broker fundamentals (RabbitMQ)
- Queue system comparisons (RabbitMQ vs Celery vs Solace)
- Payment gateway integration patterns

### Examples of Good vs Bad Usage:

**✅ GOOD - Read when needed:**
```
User: "Explain the CAP theorem"
→ Read docs/fundamentals/distributed-systems-fundamentals.md (section 1 only)

User: "How do I implement event sourcing?"
→ Read docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md (section 1)

User: "What's the Saga pattern?"
→ Read docs/phase2-architecture-patterns/event-driven-architecture.md (section 4)
```

**❌ BAD - Don't read automatically:**
```
User: "How do I run the tests?"
→ Don't read any docs, this is a practical question

User: "Debug this error in the code"
→ Don't read theory docs, focus on debugging

User: "List all the files"
→ Don't include docs in file listing, they're reference materials
```

**Why?** These files are very large (240 KB total) and contain educational content. They should only be loaded when genuinely needed for the current task to conserve tokens and improve response time.

## Notes & Learnings
(Document key insights, challenges, and solutions as you progress)

---

## Next Steps
1. Start with Phase 1: Review monolith limitations and identify decomposition boundaries
2. Set up your learning environment (Docker, local Kubernetes, cloud account)
3. Begin documenting your current system's architecture

**Remember:** System design is about trade-offs. There's no perfect solution, only solutions that fit specific requirements and constraints. Focus on understanding the "why" behind each pattern and practice making reasoned decisions.
