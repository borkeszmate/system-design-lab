> 🚧 **Work In Progress** - A developer's hands-on learning journey from monolithic applications to distributed microservices architecture

## 🎯 Overview

**This is a work-in-progress learning repository** documenting my personal journey from building monolithic applications to mastering distributed system design patterns. It features two complete implementations of an e-commerce platform that I'm actively developing and improving:

- **Monolithic Architecture** - Traditional single-application approach
- **Microservices Architecture** - Modern distributed system with event-driven communication

**Note:** This project is continuously evolving as I learn new patterns and concepts. Check the [Learning Path](#-learning-path) section to see what's implemented and what's coming next. This is also a journey to discover the deep capabilities of **Claude Code** as a development partner in building complex distributed systems.

**Perfect for:** Software engineers, system architects, and students who want to follow along with a real-world learning journey into scalable system design, microservices patterns, and distributed architectures.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏗️ **Two Complete Architectures** - Side-by-side comparison of monolith vs microservices
- 🐳 **Fully Dockerized** - One-command setup for both environments
- 📨 **Event-Driven Communication** - RabbitMQ message broker for async operations
- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation** - Detailed guides on distributed systems concepts
- 🔧 **Production-Ready Patterns** - Circuit breakers, health checks, proper error handling
- 🎯 **Real-World Use Case** - E-commerce platform with orders, payments, cart, and products
- ⚡ **Modern Stack** - FastAPI, React with Redux, PostgreSQL, TypeScript
- 🤖 **AI-Assisted Development** - Built with Claude Code to explore AI capabilities in complex system design
